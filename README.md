# BookingApp

**Project for Databases and Internet Technologies at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering**

This is a Booking Web Application in the .NET Framework 4.7.2 using a Data First approach and the
MVC architecture. The project was done in multiple iterations, each being a step in the process of
designing a relational database, along with the appropriate SQL queries for Data Definition and
Data Manipulation. 

The database management system used for this project was PostgreSQL, which resulted in a rather
time consuming process to set up everything correctly with the used version of the .NET Framework.
In order to achieve this, the NPGSQL package had to be used, for which there are inconsistent 
tutorials on the internet.

This project also uses a Custom User Implementation in .NET in order to comply with the created database,
which is local for now, meaning the project cannot be run upon cloning this repo.

Under this text are some screenshots from the web application.
